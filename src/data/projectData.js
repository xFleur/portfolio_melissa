    description: "Workbuddy is A dedicated, cute, physico-digital object that appeals to your empathy to help you take care ofâ€¦ yourself. A product deliberately designed to limit and prevent you from doing something (over-working). How it works: You plan and set your break schedule or philosophy (you can use preset methods such as the Pomodoro Technique) in the app. Work buddy will detect your work activity and will let you know it's time for a break using low-profile physical interactions (sounds, movement and 'facial expression'). You can then take the break, or 'snooze' Work Buddy, by physically interacting with it (by stroking it, for example). It will (physically) react accordingly. If you snooze it too much, hopefully you get moved by its miserable looking state and just take that break already!",
